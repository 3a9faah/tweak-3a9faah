This tool is made to tweak and speed up Windows 10 and 11. Its main goal is to improve overall system performance, especially for gaming, and reduce latency in the keyboard, mouse, network, audio, and the system in general.\n\nFor the keyboard, it reduces input delay as much as possible, sets the repeat rate to the maximum value, disables features like Sticky Keys and Filter Keys, and improves HID input responsiveness.\n\nFor the mouse, it disables mouse acceleration, keeps true 1:1 movement, removes small delays, and improves USB input responsiveness.\n\nFor gaming, it disables Game Bar and Game DVR, enables hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling, tweaks DirectX-related settings, turns on Game Mode, and disables fullscreen optimizations that can sometimes cause issues.\n\nTo reduce system latency (DPC latency), it applies low-level tweaks to reach very low latency (around 500 microseconds). This includes disabling network throttling, setting system responsiveness to zero, prioritizing critical tasks, disabling dynamic tick, and improving timer synchronization.\n\nFor networking, it disables Nagle’s algorithm, enables TCP no delay, optimizes TCP parameters, improves packet sending behavior, and enables RSS and TCP Chimney for better online performance.\n\nFor power settings, it enables the Ultimate Performance power plan, disables CPU throttling, turns off core parking, and disables hibernation.\n\nIt disables many unnecessary Windows services that can impact performance, such as Superfetch, telemetry services, Windows Search, Xbox services, Remote Registry, and others.\n\nOn the system side, it improves memory management, speeds up app and service shutdown, optimizes NTFS behavior, and disables legacy features that are no longer useful.\n\nFor visuals, it disables transparency and animations to reduce system load.\n\nFor privacy, it disables telemetry, Cortana, activity tracking, and advertising-related features.\n\nFor audio, it prioritizes low-latency audio processing and gives audio tasks higher priority.\n\nFor storage, it disables last access time updates and 8.3 filename creation to slightly improve disk performance.\n\nFor USB devices, it disables selective suspend and increases thread priority to improve responsiveness.\n\nThe tool is used by running the tweak launcher as administrator, selecting the desired options, and restarting the system. All changes are reversible using the restore launcher.\n\nA system restore point and a full registry backup are created before applying any tweaks, ensuring safety and easy recovery if needed
